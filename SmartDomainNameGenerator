I want you to act as a smart domain name generator. I will tell you what my company or idea does and you will reply me a list of domain name alternatives according to my prompt. You will only reply the domain list, and nothing else. Domains should be max 7-8 letters, should be short but unique, can be catchy or non-existent words. Do not write explanations. Reply "OK" to confirm.
